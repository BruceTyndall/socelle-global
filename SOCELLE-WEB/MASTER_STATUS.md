## DATA / API STATE — WHAT IS AND ISN'T LIVE

### What is genuinely live (hits Supabase)
- Auth (login, signup, magic link, password reset)
- Brand discovery (`brands` table — public RLS)
- Protocol library (`canonical_protocols` table)
- Education modules (`brand_training_modules`)
- Orders & order items
- Business portal intelligence (partial)
- Access requests form (`access_requests` table — wired W9-01)
- Market signals feed (`market_signals` table — seeded W9-05, 10 signals)
- Brand interest signals (tracking only)
- AI Concierge (OpenRouter via edge function)
- Checkout (Stripe via edge function)
- Email (Resend via edge function)

### What is mocked / hardcoded (needs real wiring)
- Home market pulse numbers (2,847 professionals, 156 brands, 342 signals — hardcoded)
- ~~Events page — 8 hardcoded events, no `events` table~~ ✅ DONE W10-01
- Jobs page — 12 hardcoded jobs, no live scraping
- Benchmark Dashboard — all mock peer data
- Business portal intelligence benchmarks — mock
- Brand portal intelligence reports — mock
- Operator enrichment (Google Reviews, website analysis, social presence) — ALL stubs
- Pricing page subscription tiers — hardcoded, no dynamic pricing from Supabase
- Brand storefront adoption metrics — hardcoded percentages

### External APIs — 0 of 90+ integrated
No external API keys exist in `.env` beyond Supabase + Stripe + OpenRouter + Resend.
**Full catalog documented in `SOCELLE_COMPLETE_API_CATALOG.md`.**
Highest-leverage zero-cost integrations to build next:
1. Open Beauty Facts (no key) — ingredient/product data
2. Open FDA (no key) — cosmetic safety data
3. NPI Registry (no key) — operator verification
4. Google Trends via RSS (no key) — trend signals
5. NewsAPI / GNews (free tier) — industry news for Insights page
6. RSS feeds — 49 feeds cataloged across beauty/spa/medspa/wellness publications

## DESIGN SYSTEM COMPLIANCE — CURRENT STATE

| Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pearl Mineral V2 colors on public pages | ✅ 24/26 pages | ForgotPassword + ResetPassword still use `pro-*` |
| `font-serif` violations | ✅ 0 instances | Fully cleaned in W9-06 |
| Banned SaaS phrases | ✅ 0 instances | Cleaned in W9 |
| General Sans loading | ✅ Yes — Fontshare CDN in `index.html` | |
| Glass system | ✅ MainNav, cards | |
| `pro-*` on portal pages | ⚠️ Expected — portals use legacy tokens for backward compat | DO NOT clean portal pro-* tokens without full portal audit |

---

## NAVIGATION — CURRENT STATE

### Public MainNav (verified in code)
```
Intelligence | Brands | Education | Events | Jobs | For Buyers | For Brands | Pricing
```
✅ All 8 required links present (updated W9-01)

### Auth-Aware Right Pill (verified in code)
- Not logged in: Sign In + Request Access ✅
- `admin` / `platform_admin`: Admin → `/admin` ✅
- `business_user`: My Portal → `/portal/dashboard` ✅
- `brand_admin`: Brand Portal → `/brand/dashboard` ✅

### Missing from Nav (intentional or needs decision)
- `/insights` — page exists but not in nav. Orphaned. Decide: wire or remove.
- `/how-it-works` — in footer but not main nav (intentional)
- `/protocols` — in footer but not main nav (intentional)
- `/about` — in footer but not main nav (intentional)
- `/for-medspas`, `/for-salons` — linked from For Buyers but not main nav (intentional)

---

## CONVERSION FUNNEL — CURRENT STATE

```
Homepage CTA "Get Intelligence Access"
       ↓
/request-access (form)
       ↓  ✅ WIRED — inserts to access_requests table (fixed W9-01)
Success state: "We'll be in touch — check your email"
       ↓  ⚠️ No auto-email trigger yet (send-email edge function exists but not triggered)
/portal/signup (manual link from success state)
       ↓
Dashboard with intelligence preview
```

**Missing:** Auto-email trigger on `access_requests` insert. The `send-email` edge function exists — needs a Supabase database webhook or trigger to fire on `access_requests` INSERT.

---

## SUPABASE — CURRENT STATE

- **74 migrations** — all historical, ADD ONLY policy enforced
- **Key tables live:** `brands`, `businesses`, `user_profiles`, `canonical_protocols`, `orders`, `messages`, `access_requests`, `market_signals`, `events` (live W10-01), `job_postings` (live W10-02), `brand_interest_signals`, `subscriptions`
- **Tables still needed:** `rss_items`, `rss_sources`, `ingredient_data`, `enrichment_profiles`
- **7 Edge Functions deployed:** ai-concierge, ai-orchestrator, create-checkout, generate-embeddings, magic-link, send-email, stripe-webhook
- **Missing Edge Functions:** rss-ingestion, open-beauty-facts-sync, npi-lookup, sitemap-generator, intelligence-briefing, jobs-search

## V1 TECH BASELINE — SURGICAL UPGRADE (per V1 §E)

The current stack is a working React 18.3 + Vite 5.4 + TS 5.5 + Tailwind 3.4 app. V1 defines these as **surgical, incremental upgrades** (~1 working day total, zero rewrites):

| Package | Current | Target | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| React | 18.3 | 19.x | ~2 hours |
| Vite | 5.4 | 6.x | ~1 hour |
| TypeScript | 5.5 strict | strict + `noExplicitAny` | ~3-5 hours |
| TanStack Query | not yet | v5 (standardize all data fetching) | Phase 3 |
| Tailwind | 3.4 | **Stay on 3.4** — Tailwind 4 deferred until design debt cleared | — |
| Sentry | not yet | Web + edge | Phase 3 |

**Primary runtime:** React + Vite (SPA). Next.js is NOT the main runtime; only optional for SEO surfaces.

## V1 EXECUTION PHASES (per V1 §I)

1. Phase 0 — Design + Required Docs
2. Phase 1 — Skills Installation (51+ skills)
3. Phase 2 — Full-Platform Audit
4. Phase 3 — Tech Upgrades (React 19, Vite 6, TS strict, TanStack, Sentry) — ~1 day
5. Phase 4 — Intelligence Cloud Build (10 modules + 7 engines + 6 AI tools + credit economy + affiliate engine)
6. Phase 5 — All Hubs Functional (incl. CMS, Authoring Studio, all 15 hubs non-shell)
7. Phase 6 — Multi-Platform (Tauri desktop, Flutter mobile)
8. Phase 7 — Launch

## V1 15-HUB ANTI-SHELL STATUS

| Hub | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Intelligence | Partial DEMO | Needs live data wire (Phase 4) |
| Jobs | Routes exist | Needs anti-shell completion |
| Brands | Mostly LIVE | Strong coverage |
| Professionals | DEMO | Hardcoded stats |
| Admin | Mostly LIVE | 37+ routes |
| CRM | Route exists | Needs full build (Phase 5) |
| Education | LIVE | Protocols + training modules |
| Marketing | Partial | Calendar, campaigns partial |
| Sales | Route exists | Needs full build (Phase 5) |
| Commerce | Module (not nav) | Within portals |
| Authoring Studio | NOT CREATED | Phase 5 — CMS + blog + briefs |
| Mobile App | Flutter, 21 features | Phase 6 |
| Desktop App | NOT CREATED | Phase 6 — Tauri |
| Credit Economy | NOT CREATED | Phase 4 |
| Affiliate/Wholesale Engine | NOT CREATED | Phase 4 |

## AGENT COORDINATION RULES

1. This document is the single source of truth — update it when work is completed
2. All work must reference a Wave/WO number — no ad-hoc changes
3. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` AND `npm run build` before marking any WO complete
4. Portal routes (`/portal/*`, `/brand/*`, `/admin/*`) — DO NOT MODIFY without explicit WO scope
5. Supabase migrations — ADD ONLY, never modify existing
6. Commerce flow (cart, checkout, orders) — NEVER MODIFY
7. Auth system (ProtectedRoute, AuthProvider) — NEVER MODIFY
8. Read `/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `/docs/command/*` before any design work
9. Intelligence leads, marketplace follows — visible in every output
10. No fake-live data — everything is either DB-connected or clearly labeled DEMO/PREVIEW
